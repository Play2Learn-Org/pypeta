# Pypeta

Simulate [Liquid Handling Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_handling_robot) in Python with an interactive web interface.

The goal is to have a platform where:

 * **Developers** can experiment with writing programs for robots, without having to deal with physical errors like destroying equipment.
 * **Scientists** can define experiments and outcomes in a dynamic, reproducable way.
 * **Students** can play around and get a feel for the pipetting work and robot management, as well as the development of software in this space.
 * **Manufacturers** can have a market-wide standard of non-competitive software and API features with reduced and shared development cost.

In an ideal world programs written for this simulator should be usable or compilable to real-world robot interfaces.
